I'm sorry, but an uncaught exception occurred.

While running game code:
  File "game/scripts/script.rpy", line 7, in script
    n "Good evening, investigator. We received a call earlier regarding the famous painter, Peter Painter, who was found dead in his studio apartment. His neighbours claim to have heard a heated argument at around 6pm with a woman, and went to check up on him later at 10pm, only to find him dead. There was a knife found in his chest, and his body appeared to have several cuts on the arms, he bled quite a bit. We’re not sure of the motive behind this death, so we need you to be thorough. I’ll give you a fair warning, investigator, there is quite a bit of blood on this scene. You may enter whenever you’re ready."
